# Jing Dong Health Competition: Detection of Sleep Apnea and Hypopnea

This competition focuses on wearable sleep monitoring scenarios. By analyzing a patient's blood oxygen and heart rate data, it aims to detect apnea and hypopnea events, helping to warn patients of potential health risks.

Building upon [yunsuxiaozi's feature engineering](https://github.com/yunsuxiaozi/AI-and-competition/tree/main/202406datacastle%E7%9D%A1%E7%9C%A0%E4%BA%8B%E4%BB%B6%E6%A3%80%E6%B5%8Bbaseline), I incorporated additional medically relevant features related to biological information, which have shown strong performance in ECG, EEG, and similar datasets. In addition, I used both xgboost and LGBM to make a fusion classification, there're more details in my solution! Finally, my solution achieved an accuracy exceeding 0.67 in the competition.

Feel free to reach out for discussion!
